# Question number 1
This repository contains the answers to the backend developer internship test at Scafol. In this test, I used the Go programming language using GORM, Mux, MySql

From the questions given, there are three requirements, namely
1. Create a discussion
2. See all the existing discussions
3. View any of the discussions

therefore there are three endpoints
1. / api / discussions -> [POST] to create new discussions
2. / api / discussions -> [GET] to see all existing discussions
3. / api / discussions / {id} -> [GET] to view a discussion
